GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                           Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

 The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
 and other kinds of works.

 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
 the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
 software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
 GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
 any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to
 your programs, too.

 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
 Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
 freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if
 you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
 that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
 programs, and that you know that you can do these things.

 To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these
 rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
 certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
 you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
 or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
 you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
 source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

 Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
 (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
 giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

 For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
 that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users'
 and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
 changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
 authors of previous versions.

 Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
 modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
 can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting
 users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of
 such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is
 precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this
 version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such
 problems arise in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision
 to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed.

 Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
 States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
 software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
 make sure that free programs are not endangered without a threat of
 likewise turning them into proprietary programs. To prevent this, the GPL
 assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
 follow.

                            TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 0. Definitions.

 "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

 "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
 works, such as semiconductor masks.

 "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
 Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may
 be individuals or organizations.

 To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
 in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
 an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
 earlier work.

 A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a modified version
 of the Program.

 To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
 permission under copyright law, would make you liable or cause you to be
 sued for infringement.

 To "convey" a covered work means any kind of propagation that enables
 other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user
 through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

 An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the
 extent that it includes a convenient and prominent visible feature that
 (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that
 there is no warranty for the work (unless the provided warranty is the
 extent to which the copyright holders provide a warranty) and that licensees
 may convey the work under the terms of this License, and how to view a
 copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands
 or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list would suffice
 to fulfill this requirement.

 1. Source Code.

 The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
 modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

 A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
 standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of user
 interfaces, one that is implemented by more than one independent implementor
 of publicly available source code.

 "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the
 work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a
 Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and
 (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or
 to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available
 to the public in source code form. A "Major Component", in this context,
 means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of
 the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs,
 or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used
 to run it.

 The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
 the source code needed to generate, install, and run the object code and to
 modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However,
 it does not include System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally
 available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those
 activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding
 Source includes interface definition files associated with source files,
 and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms
 that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
 communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of
 the work.

 The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate
 automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

 The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

 2. Basic Permissions.

 All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright
 on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
 This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the
 unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this
 License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.
 This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent,
 as provided by copyright law.

 You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
 without condition so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You
 may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them run
 them for you, on your behalf, without complying with the terms of this
 License, provided you are satisfied that they will not make or propagate
 any copies of the copyrightable aspects of the work.

 3. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

 You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
 it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish
 on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices
 stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with
 section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any
 warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the
 Program.

 You may charge any price or no price for each copy of the source code that
 you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

 4. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

 You may convey a Modified Version of the Program's source code in any
 medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each
 copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating
 that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with
 section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any
 warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the
 Program.

 5. Conveying Object Code.

 You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
 sections 3 and 4, provided that you also convey the
 Corresponding Source code and comply with the terms of section 6.

 6. Corresponding Source.

 You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
 section 4 and 5, provided that the Corresponding Source is
 conveyed also, under the terms of this License.

 A Corresponding Source for a work in object code form is as defined
 in section 1. However, as a special exception, the Corresponding Source
 distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
 either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
 and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless
 that component itself accompanies the executable.

 If conveyance of the object code is made by offering access to copy from a
 designated place (gratis or for a fee), then offering equivalent access to
 copy the Corresponding Source from the same place satisfies the requirement
 to convey the Corresponding Source, even though recipients are not
 required to download the Corresponding Source along with the object code.

 7. Additional Terms.

 "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License
 by making exceptions to one or more of its conditions.
 Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
 be treated as if they were included in this License's terms, to the
 extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions
 apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under
 those permissions, if the permission granted to do so are explicit.

 8. Termination.

 You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
 provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify
 it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License
 (including any patent licenses granted under it).

 However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
 from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
 unless the copyright holder has terminated your license permanently, and
 (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the
 violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

 Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
 permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
 reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
 violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and
 you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

 Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
 licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
 this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
 reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material
 under section 10.

 9. Acceptance Not Required For Having Copies.

 You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a
 copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely
 as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy
 likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this
 License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.
 These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.
 Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
 acceptance of this License to do so.

 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

 Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a
 license from the original copyright holders, to run, modify and propagate
 that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing
 compliance by third parties with this License.

 11. Patent License.

 A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License
 of the Program or a corresponding work for which that contributor has
 authority to grant copyright permission.

 A "patent license" is any express agreement or commitment, however
 denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to
 practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).

 If you convey a covered work, you irrevocably grant all recipients a
 patent license to run, modify, and propagate the covered work, where the
 work could be made, used, or sold, or otherwise propagated, by means of
 exercising your copyright in the covered work. This includes the right to
 cause a third party to make, use, sell, offer for sale, or import a copy of
 the work.

 This grant does not extend to patents that you control that are embodied
 in works and compilations outside the covered work.

 You accept a patent license from each contributor with respect to the
 contributor's contribution to the covered work.

 A recipient conveying a covered work may overtly rely on the contributor's
 patent license granted to the recipient, and the contributor may not
 revoke that patent license.

 12. No Free Lunch.

 Nothing in this License requires you to accede to any other terms relating
 to the covered work. In particular, you do not renounce any right to receive
 payment for copies of the work that you have supplied.

 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to
 link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of
 the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to
 convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to
 apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special provisions
 of the GNU Affero General Public License will apply to the combination
 as such.

 14. Revised Versions of this License.

 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
 GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
 similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
 new problems or concerns.

 Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
 specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License
 "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the
 terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version
 published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify
 a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any
 version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

 THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
 OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
 EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
 ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
 SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
 SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 16. Limitation of Liability.

 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
 THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
 GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
 USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
 DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
 PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
 EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
 SUCH DAMAGES.

 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

 If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
 cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing
 courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute
 waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a
 warranty or assumption of liability cannot be avoided for a given purpose.

                            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                   How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
  the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

      This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
      it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
      the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
      (at your option) any later version.

      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
      GNU General Public License for more details.

      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
      along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interactional, start it in an interactive
  mode with a notice like this:

      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
      This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
      This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
      under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
